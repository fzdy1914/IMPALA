### Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures
This repository contains an PyTorch implementation of "Importance Weighted Actor-Learner
Architectures".

For a detailed description of the architecture please read [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01561).
### Requirements
- Python >=3.7
- PyTorch >=1.2.0
- atari_py >=0.1.7
- cv2 >= 3.4.2

### TODO
